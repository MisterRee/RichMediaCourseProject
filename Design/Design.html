    <h1>ServerWiper</h1>
    <p>The main inspiration is off of a Steam PC game called "
    <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/270150/">Running With Rifles</a>
    ". The premise being quick and hectic gameplay, but with hints of strategic depth and skill.</p>
    <p>The Story will be along the lines with the player is contributing to digital warfare,
       and has to clear enemy connections on the battleground server.</p>
    <p>The game will be a top-down shooter with WASD for movement and mouse for aiming.
       Characters will be round circles, and bullets will do more damage as they travel
       through characters, so aiming right towards the middle of enemies will deal the most damage.
       Characters will be designed so that players do not usually instantly die after taking any shot.
       As development continues, I plan to add technical game mechanics to improve mobility,
       and add depth to the game.</p>
    <p>Controls will be fairly simple, starting off with WASD and mouse.
       As more controlls are needed they will be placed appropriately around WASD.</p>
    <p>This multiplayer game syncs different clients together in a same map,
      allowing them to interact with each other.</p>
    <p>The client platform is intended to be non-mobile HTML5.</p>
    <p>The server will be used to collect user inputs,
       and broadcast them to change in every player's clients.
       The game will require players to create an account
       which will get stored in a mongo database.
       Through their accounts users will be able to see their game statistics,
       as well as preset loadouts before entering the gameplay.</p>
    <p>There will be no art assets that I need and everything will be drawn client side using canvas.
       Sound assets are something I can be confident that I can generate on my own.
       I don't intend to theme it like gritty warfare as my inspiration,
       but more so like white room/color contrast,
       for instance <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/322500/">Super Hot</a>.</p>
    <p>Here's the flow of the project that I am envisioning so far.
       I can imagine this will be prone to minor changes.</p>
